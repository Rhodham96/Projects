# Projects

Welcome to the **Projects** repository! This repo serves as a central hub for my collection of smaller machine learning and deep learning projects. As I explore new ideas and techniques, I'll add them here for learning, experimentation, and sharing with the community.

## Overview

This repository is a living collection of my experiments and learning journeys in machine learning. The focus is on practical code, clear documentation, and sharing insights. Each project is self-contained within its own directory, with code, documentation, and (where relevant) sample results.

## Current Projects

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A basic implementation of a CNN for image classification tasks. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation using a standard dataset.

**Features:**
- Data loading and augmentation
- Custom CNN architecture
- Training loop and evaluation metrics

### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

A simple GAN designed to generate synthetic data/images. The project showcases the interplay between generator and discriminator networks, loss curves, and sample outputs.

**Features:**
- Basic GAN architecture
- Training process visualization
- Generated sample outputs
